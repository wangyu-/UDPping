# Getting Started

### Step 1

Set up a udp echo server at the host you want to ping. 

There are many ways of doing this, my favourite way is:

```
socat -v UDP-LISTEN:4000,fork PIPE
```

Now a echo server is listening at port 4000. 

###### Note
If you dont have socat, use `apt install socat` or `yum install socat`, you will get it.

### Step 2

Ping you server.

Assume `44.55.66.77` is the IP of your server.

```
./udpping.py 44.55.66.77 4000
```

Done!

Now UDPping will generate outputs as a normal ping, but the protocol used is `UDP` instead of `ICMP`.

# Advanced Usage
```
root@raspberrypi:~# ./udpping.py
 usage:
   this_program <dest_ip> <dest_port>
   this_program <dest_ip> <dest_port> "<options>" 

 options:
   LEN         the length of payload, unit:byte
   INTERVAL    the seconds waited between sending each packet, as well as the timeout for reply packet, unit: ms
   COUNT       the count of packets, default is unlimited

 examples:
   ./udpping.py 44.55.66.77 4000
   ./udpping.py 44.55.66.77 4000 "LEN=400;INTERVAL=2000;COUNT=100"
   ./udpping.py fe80::5400:ff:aabb:ccdd 4000
   
```
